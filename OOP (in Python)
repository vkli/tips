#Basically, an object x of class Name has attributes x.attribute and methods x.method. These attributes can be changed independently of each other. The changes apply to x independently of other objects.

#example code
#replace value with a number such as 1
#replace f(input, attribute) with a function such as input+self.attribute
#replace f(input2, attribute) with a function such as input2+self.attribute
class Name(object):
	attribute=value
	def __init__(self, input):
		self.attribute2=f(input, self.attribute)
	def method(self, input2):
		self.attribute2=f(input2, self.attribute)

#example result
#replace input with a number such as 1
#replace input2 with a number such as 2
>>> x=Name(input)
>>>x.attribute
value
>>> x.attribute2
f(input, value)
>>> x.method(input2)
>>>x.attribute2
f(input2,value)
