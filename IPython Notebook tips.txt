Note Python and iPython Notebook are the same except:
1. Python commands/output are entered/displayed in command terminal. iPython commands/output are entered/displayed in web browser GUI.
2. Python modules/scripts are written as .py text files and imported and run in the command terminal or Python Shell. iPython modules/scripts are written as iPython notebooks and opened and run in the web browser GUI.
