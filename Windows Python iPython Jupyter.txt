Python

Getting started:
https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter0/

Check whether your OS is 64-bit or 32-bit:
Start>Control Panel>System
check whether System Type says 64-bit or 32-bit

Install python3.6.5 64-bit (pip automatically comes with 3.4+) using:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-365/ (x86-64 executable installer)

or

Install python3.6.5 32-bit on windows by going to https://www.python.org/downloads/, it will display "Download the latest version for Windows," then just click "Download Python 3.6.5."

Open python:
(applications>IDLE)
returns Python 3.6.5 (default, May 02 2018, 12:00:00) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win64
>>> 1+1
returns 2

Close python:
>>>exit()

Open python3.6 from commandline (cmd in Windows):
Check path:
(System Properties > Environment Variables > System Variables>Path)
(copy C:...\Python36)
(from commandline)
$cd (paste C:...\Python36)
$dir
find the name of the python.exe file: (in this case: python)
Open python:
(type name of the python.exe file)
$python 
Close python:
>>>exit()

Check pip3.6 works:
(from commandline)
(type name of the python.exe file, -m, pip)
$ python -m pip
or
$ python -m ensurepip --default-pip

Upgrade pip3.6:
$python -m pip install --upgrade pip

Install module using pip3.6:
$ python -m pip install numpy

Check module works:
(from IDLE)
>>> import numpy
>>> numpy.array([1,2,3])
(prints

iPython/Jupyter Notebook

Use pip to install/update Jupyter (previously called Ipython) + Notebook + Dependencies:
(Commandline)
(if anything is already installed, will tell you)
(installs to Python3.7 using pip3.7)
$pip3.7 install jupyter[all]

Uninstall Jupyter from Python3.7:
$pip3.7 uninstall jupyter[all]

Install Jupytor on Python3.6:
$pip3.6 install jupyter[all]

Run Jupyter Notebook:
$jupyter notebook
(Choose location for notebook)
(Click New>Jupyter 3 Notebook)
(from Notebook)
>>>1+1
SHIFT-ENTER (runs code)
(result: 2)

If error:
Connecting to Kernel
A connection to the notebook server could not be established. The notebook will continue trying to reconnect, but until it does, you will NOT be able to run code. Check your network connection or notebook server configuration
Then:
$pip3.6 install tornado==4.5.3

Exit Jupyter Notebook:
CTRL-C

# = comment

No undo, instead:
CTRL-S (Creates Checkpoint)
Revert to Checkpoint

#but can only have 1 checkpoint at a time :(
Instead, File > Make a copy



Evaluate cell:

[Shift-Enter] 

#only outputs last output, for rest use print(Ã¬textÃ®,calculations)

#Heading cells must also be evaluated

#to edit Heading cells, double-click



[*] means busy
must close plots in order for program to continue

To abort:

Kernel>Interrupt
