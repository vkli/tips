Python

Getting started:
https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter0/

Check whether your OS is 64-bit or 32-bit:
Start>Control Panel>System
check whether System Type says 64-bit or 32-bit

Install python3.7 64-bit (pip automatically comes with 3.4+) using:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release (x86-64 executable installer)

or

Install python3.7 32-bit on windows by going to https://www.python.org/downloads/, it will display "Download the latest version for Windows," then just click "Download Python 3.7."

Open python:
(applications>IDLE)
prints Python 3.7 (default, May 02 2018, 12:00:00) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on win64
>>> 1+1
prints 2

Close python:
>>>exit()

Open python3.7 from commandline (cmd in Windows):
Check path:
(System Properties > Environment Variables > System Variables>Path)
(copy C:...\Python37)
(from commandline)
$cd (paste C:...\Python37)
$dir
find the name of the python3.7.exe file: (in this case: python3.7)
Open python:
(type name of the python3.7.exe file)
$python3.7 
Close python:
>>>exit()

Check pip3.7 works:
(from commandline)
(type name of the python3.7.exe file, -m, pip)
$ python3.7 -m pip
or
$pip3.7
or
$ python3.7 -m ensurepip --default-pip

Upgrade pip3.7:
$pip3.7 install --upgrade pip

Install module using pip3.7:
$ pip3.7 install numpy

Check module works:
(from IDLE)
>>> import numpy
>>> numpy.array([1,2,3])
(should print an array: array([1,2,3]))

View installed modules:
$pip3.7 list

--------------------------------------------------

iPython/Jupyter Notebook

Use pip to install/update Jupyter (previously called Ipython) + Notebook + Dependencies:
(Commandline)
(if anything is already installed, will tell you)
(installs to Python3.7 using pip3.7)
$pip3.7 install jupyter[all]

Unfortunately it's in the wrong place.

View actual installed modules (right place):
$cd (paste C:...\Python37)
$cd lib
$dir
(shows all the modules as .py files)

To actually install modules in future:
get the .py file and put in C:...\Python37\lib

Uninstall Jupyter from Python3.7:
$pip3.7 uninstall jupyter[all]

Install Jupyter on Python3.6:
$python -m pip install jupyter[all]

Run Jupyter Notebook (right place) on Python3.7:
$jupyter notebook
(Choose location for notebook)
(Click New>Jupyter 3 Notebook)
(from Notebook)
>>>1+1
SHIFT-ENTER (runs code)
(result: 2)

If error:
Connecting to Kernel
A connection to the notebook server could not be established. The notebook will continue trying to reconnect, but until it does, you will NOT be able to run code. Check your network connection or notebook server configuration
Then:
$python -m pip install tornado==4.5.3

Exit Jupyter Notebook:
CTRL-C

# = comment

No undo, instead:
CTRL-S (Creates Checkpoint)
Revert to Checkpoint

#but can only have 1 checkpoint at a time :(
Instead, File > Make a copy



Evaluate cell:

[Shift-Enter] 

#only outputs last output, for rest use print(Ã¬textÃ®,calculations)

#Heading cells must also be evaluated

#to edit Heading cells, double-click



[*] means busy
must close plots in order for program to continue

To abort:

Kernel>Interrupt
