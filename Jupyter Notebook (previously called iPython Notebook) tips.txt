Note Python and Jupyter Notebook (previously called iPython Notebook) are the same except:
1. Python commands/output are entered/displayed in command terminal. Jupyter Notebook commands/output are entered/displayed in web browser notebook.
2. Python modules/scripts are written as .py text files and imported and run in the command terminal or Python Shell. Jupyter Notebook modules/scripts are written and run as notebooks in the web browser.
