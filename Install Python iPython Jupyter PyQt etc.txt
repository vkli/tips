Install Python from python.org/downloads
Accepting defaults installs it to /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7 (for version 3.7)

http://www.python.org/download/mac/tcltk/
Python 3.6- (both IDLE and ipynb) crash when you run tkinter gui and press option-U
Python 3.7+ come with their own private version of Tcl/Tk 8.6 and no longer use system-supplied or third-party supplied versions of Tcl/Tk

Python 3.7 (Python.org) and 2.7.x (comes with Mac in /System/Library/Frameworks, you should normally not modify or delete files in /System/Library) can both be installed on your system and will not conflict. 

"One more thing: to verify the identity of secure network connections, this Python needs a set of SSL root certificates.  You can download and install a current curated set from the Certifi project by double-clicking on the Install Certificates icon in the Finder window.  See the ReadMe file for more information."

Run Python:
(Terminal)
$python3.7
>>>1+1
>>>exit()
or
$idle3.7
>>>1+1
>>>exit()

Upgrade Pip (Python package manager, automatically installed with Python3.4+):
(Terminal)
$pip3.7 install --upgrade pip

If not installed, install pip (for version, say, 3.5):
Download get-pip.py from http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html into current directory
$sudo python3.5 get-pip.py

Uninstall pip (for, say, pip3.7):
$ pip3.7 uninstall pip
$ pip3.7

Reinstall pip (for, say, pip3.7):
$ python3.7 -m ensurepip --default-pip

Use pip to install/update Jupyter (previously called Ipython) + Notebook + Dependencies:
(Terminal)
(if anything is already installed, will tell you)
$pip3.7 install jupyter[all]

Find Jupyter Notebook path if needed:
Applications>Python3.7>Update Shell Profile.command 
or
$pip3.6 show jupyter

Run Jupyter Notebook (runs in browser, even with no internet connection!):
(Terminal)
$jupyter notebook
or
$/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.6/bin/jupyter notebook
(if you get error message:
execution error: "http://localhost:8888/tree…” doesn’t understand the “open location” message
then copy/paste http://localhost:8888/tree… into browser)

Check versions:
Help > About (includes Python version)
$jupyter --version
$jupyter notebook --version
$pip3.7 --version
$pip3.7 list (includes pip version)

Exit Jupyter Notebook:
(Close browser or Logout)
(Terminal)
[CTRL-C]
exit? y [Enter]

( Can uninstall a version of Jupyter Notebook:
(Terminal)
(uninstalls jupyter/notebook from python3.6, keeps jupyter/notebook from python3.7)
$pip3.6 uninstall jupyter notebook
Uninstalling jupyter…Proceed? y
Uninstalling notebook…Proceed? y )

Install modules:
(Terminal)
(anything you install in python will be usable in python notebook)
(if already installed, will tell you)
$pip3.7 install numpy scipy matplotlib openpyxl statsmodels (dependencies will be automatically installed: $pip3.7 install pandas patsy cython) scikit-learn  

Check TkInter is installed:
(Terminal)
$python3.7
$import tkinter
$tkinter._test()
$exit()

Install PyQt on Python2.7 using MacPorts:
(Terminal)
$port search pyqt4
$sudo port install py27-pyqt4 #installs PyQt4 on Python2.7 in Applications/Macports

( Can install TkInter on Python2.7 using MacPorts:
$sudo port install py27-tkinter )

Run PyQt:
Open Applications/MacPorts/Python2.7/IDLE
(IDLE = Python Shell)
$import PyQt4 #must type this exactly, if no error then you successfully installed PyQt
$exit()

Update versions: 
install new python version by repeating above steps
$pip3.7 install -U pip
$pip3.7 install -U notebook
$pip3.7 install pipdate
$pipdate3
(updates all modules)

Uninstall old python versions if you'd like (for example Python3.7):
(from admin account)
$cd /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions
$sudo rm -rf 3.7
(type admin password)
$cd /usr/local/bin
$sudo rm -rf *3.7*
Applications > Python3.7 > Move To Trash

By the way, check out this cool thing:
$python3.7
>>> import this
