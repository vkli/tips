Note Python and iPython Notebook are the same except:
1. Python commands/output are entered/displayed in command terminal. iPython commands/output are entered/displayed in web browser GUI.
2. Python modules/scripts are written as .py text files and imported and run in the command terminal or Python Shell. iPython modules/scripts are written as iPython notebooks and opened and run in the web browser GUI.

Run scripts fib, fib2 from module fibo.py in terminal:
(Terminal)
(Navigate to directory containing fibo.py)
$ python3
$ import fibo
$ fibo.fib(1000)
$ fibo.fib2(100)
$ exit()

Note if you add the following to the end of fibo.py:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    fib(int(sys.argv[1]))
Then you can run module fibo.py as a script in terminal:
(Terminal)
(Navigate to directory containing fibo.py)
$ python3 fibo.py 1000
