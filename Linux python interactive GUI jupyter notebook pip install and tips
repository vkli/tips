$ is from terminal
>>> is from Python
[] is from Jupyter



(Python2 is usually already installed)
To get and use Python3:

Linux package manager > install for Python3 (if not already installed):
python3
pip
jupyter qtconsole
jupyter notebook

Optional:
jupyter doc
jupyter core

In other words, whatever will create the files (view in Linux package manager > Package > Files):
/usr/bin/python3
/usr/bin/pip3
/usr/bin/jupyter-qtconsole
/usr/bin/jupyter-notebook

Optional:
path to jupyter-doc
/usr/bin/jupyter



Run python3 (interactive mode):

$python3
>>> 1+1
ENTER
(returns 2)
>>> os.getcwd()
ENTER
(returns current working directory)
$exit()



Run python3 (GUI):

$jupyter-qtconsole
OR 
$jupyter qtconsole 
(if jupyter core installed)

Can do multiline editing (Help > Show QtConsole help, q):
[]a=1
CTRL-ENTER
[]b=2
CTRL-ENTER
[]print(a+b)
ENTER
(returns 3)

Can copy-paste and run multiline:
copy-paste above code
ENTER

Can save as .html file and view:
File > Save to HTML > Save as qtconsole.html
Double-click qtconsole.html

[]exit



Run python3 (jupyter notebook):
(this runs jupyter for the highest version of python installed on your computer)

$cd [working directory you want to use]
$jupyter-notebook
OR
$jupyter notebook
(if jupyter core installed)

File > New > Python3
Help > About (tells you python, notebook version)
[]1+1
SHIFT-ENTER
(returns 2)
Save as name.ipynb
Can only undo to latest checkpoint! To create multiple checkpoints, just create multiple copies: 
File > Make A Copy
Close window
$CTRL-C
$y



Install modules (will be usable from both Python3 and Jupyter Notebook):

Linux package manager > install python3-[module name]
OR
$pip3 install [module name]

Recommended modules:
matbplotlib
numpy
scipy
pandas
tkinter
pycrypto



View Jupyter docs:

$cd [path to jupyter-doc]
$cat index.rst
OR
https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/5.2.3/ 
etc.
